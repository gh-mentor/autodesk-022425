I need help creating a project plan to build a web service that will hook into the Bing public search engine. 
- The service will be using NodeJS with Express server-side and ReactJS client-side.
- The service will support indexing internal content and processes search queries through a dispatch using 'Axious'. 
- The service will use threads to handle different tasks concurrently and include the dispatch logic to route queries to either Bing or an internal indexer, depending on the query type. 
- The service will adhere to SOLID principles and properly handle errors and exceptions. 
- The service will be using  DocTest for testing. 

Provide a breakdown high-level steps to accomplish this goal. I do not need code examples yet.
